Mapserver Web Widgets
An HTML Client Library to interface with UMN Mapserver

MWW consists of three main pieces:
    - mww.config.php -> this is where you'll set the appropriate paths and a few variables.
                 *** For most applications, this is the only file you'll need to edit. ***
    - mww.php -> this php/mapscript application reads the essential variables
                 from the mapfile and outputs all the needed javascript
    - mww.js -> this is the object-oriented javascript library upon which
                you can build your web mapping client. It relies heavily on 
                all sorts of other javascript libs (included in the mww/javascript directory)

To load the mww library you need to create a php page, set the mapfile and include the mww.php file. This will create a javascript object called "mww". The web map widgets can be placed in your html like so:

-----------------------------------------------
<html>
<?php
$mapfile = '/path/to/mapfile.map';
include('./mww/mww.php');
?>
<body>

Layer List:
<script>
 mww.layers.draw();
</script>

Map:
<script>
 mww.display.draw();
</script>

Reference Map:
<script>
 mww.refmap.draw();
</script>
------------------------------------------------
etc...

There is an example php page at mww/templates/template1.php which gives an example of using most of the available widgets and the mww/templates/style1.css shows how the CSS classes for the widgets can be manipulated.

To use the template, 
 - copy these two files
 - edit the $mapfile variable in template1.php
 - edit the path to mww.php (if the relative location has changed)
