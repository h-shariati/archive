This geocoding plugin for QGIS was written in the new python bindings.

The geocoding is provided by a web service (Yahoo by default) and the abstraction code for interacting with the geocoding services is provided by geopy (included in source tree ... http://exogen.case.edu/projects/geopy/ ). Other geocoders can be used with this library but Yahoo is the only one I can get to work reliably at this point.

You'll need to get a Yahoo API key if you're going to use this legit. 

There are many holes/bugs/missing features that need to be worked on. Consider this an alpha release.

The code was mostly an experiment to learn the qgis python bindings and pyqt4 but it turned out to be a useful tool ;-) Enjoy,
